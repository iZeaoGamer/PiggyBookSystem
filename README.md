## What does this plugin do?
This plugin allows you to buy a custom enchantment book from /ceshop.
You can buy 4 types of Books. Each are defined by rarities.
Once you have bought the custom enchantment book, you can interact with it, essentially allowing you to receive a random custom enchantment from that book you just bought.
After that, you can drag the book, and drop it on the appropriate item, depending on what item the custom enchantment is compatible with.
